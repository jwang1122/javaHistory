# 2020-06-08 Homework

* Please find attached pdf file named "12023 Harmoney School Houston.pdf", and use String.format() we have learned in our class, do as much as you could to solve each math problem. If you stuck anywhere, put in your homework, let me know which one you cannot do. Keep in mind, Java can do all of the math with no problem at all, maybe in the different way.
